Annotation Helper Tool
===

The `annotation` folder contains a Flask App which helps to generate training data for to train the probabilistic model to recognize common splitting patterns.
To run the app, go to the folder use
```
python annotation.py
```
Currently supports only one user, credentials are set to 'admin' and 'password'.

Meant as an auxilliary tool to [sandhi-splitter](https://github.com/jerinphilip/sandhi-splitter)
